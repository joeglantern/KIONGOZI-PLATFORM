âš¡ Goal: Build a beautiful, AI-powered civic education mini web app for Kenyan youth, using Gemini 2.0 Flash for the AI backend.
ðŸŽ¨ Design Style: Take inspiration from https://yoma.world/ â€“ clean, modern, human-designed UI (no obvious AI patterns). Use bold gradients, soft animations, good spacing, rounded edges, real typography, and mobile responsiveness. Make it look like a Dribbble design.

Create a modern, mobile-first civic education web app for Kenyan youth that is powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash.

ðŸ§  Features (Mini MVP):
- Homepage with a hero section that has animated text, a call-to-action, and a clean header with logo and navigation.
- About Section: Describes the mission to educate youth about elections, leadership, and civic duties.
- LMS Preview: A section showing sample learning modules like "Why Voting Matters," "How Elections Work in Kenya," "Youth in Leadership."
- Ask AI Section: Embed a chat interface where users can ask AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash) questions like "How do I register to vote in Kenya?" or "What is devolution?"
- Testimonials/Impact Section: Show 2â€“3 fictional testimonials from youths who benefited from civic education.
- Footer with contact links and social icons.

ðŸŽ¨ Design:
- Use bold, vibrant gradients (inspired by yoma.world).
- Typography should feel editorial â€” like Inter or DM Sans.
- Buttons and UI elements must be rounded (border-radius: 16px+).
- Animate text on scroll, fade in sections (use Framer Motion or GSAP).
- Clean spacing and layout using grid/flexbox.
- Absolutely avoid default AI-generated UI elements or obvious patterns.

ðŸ’¬ Technologies:
- Frontend: React (Next.js or Vite), TailwindCSS for styling.
- AI: Gemini 2.0 Flash API for answering questions.
- Keep it lightweight but impressive. Focus on front-end polish and micro-interactions.
- No authentication or backend dashboard needed for this version.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
This is just a demo to pitch to a UNDP/NGO-backed team. It should feel like a national project with care in design and attention to detail.

Optional: Include a section titled "Our Partners" with dummy logos of NGOs or institutions.
